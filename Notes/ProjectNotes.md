# Thoughts

- you could have cores that do AOT compilation
- hotspot like JIT
- a core with 64+ particles that run a helios like OS
- the MMU is entirely software based (see transmeta)
- spare particle cores for specialized jobs like
    - garbage collection
    - power management
    - software updating
    - failover
- Implement python (or whatever) compiler/interpreter as a core triggered by the larger system
